# SAS Analysis of Baldness Clinical Trial

We consider a hypothetical clinical trial for a new drug to treat male pattern baldness. Unlike a real clinical trial where initial efficacy against a placebo and effectiveness compared to existing commercial rivals would be considered separately (as phase II and phase III clinical trials respectively), here we suppose that the new drug (Luxuriant) is considered in the same trial with both a placebo and two existing anti-baldness treatments BaldBeGone and HairyGoodness. The patients, all of whom were more or less totally bald, were randomly allocated to the groups, shaved and then had any hair growth measured after one month of treatment.

We undertook an analysis to answer the following questions of interest to the company:
* Is there an effect of Luxuriant above and beyond the placebo
* Is Luxuriant more effective than the existing treatments on the market
* Is age relevant to any effect?

All analysis was conducted using SAS Studio.
