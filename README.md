# SAS_Analysis_of_Clinical_Trial_Investigating_Baldness

Imagine a clinical trial for a new drug to treat male pattern baldness. Unlike a real clinical trial where initial efficacy against a placebo and effectiveness compared to existing commercial rivals would be considered separately (as phase II and phase III clinical trials respectively), here we will suppose that the new drug (Luxuriant) is considered in the same trial with both a placebo and two existing anti-baldness treatments BaldBeGone and HairyGoodness. The patients, all of whom were more or less totally bald, were randomly allocated to the groups, shaved and then had any hair growth measured after one month of treatment.

The questions that are of interest to the company are 1) Is there an effect of Luxuriant above and beyond the placebo 2) Is Luxuriant more effective than the existing treatments on the market 3) Is age relevant to any effect?
